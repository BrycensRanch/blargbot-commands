It uses the [RPM package format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RPM_Package_Manager) with [urpmi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urpmi) as its package manager.  Mageia allows you to pick which Desktop Environment or Window Manager you would like to use during the install process.\r\n**[Screenshots of Mageia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Mageia_8)**",

            "value": "• [urpmi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urpmi) is separated into multiple commands instead of arguments and is not very intuitive to use, but [dnf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNF_(software\\)) is also installed by default.\r\n• 3rd party repositories for Mageia are very rare, so may have troubles finding packages that are not in the base repositories.\r\n• Has let their SSL certificate expire as of 9/2/24.\r\n• Being independent means they have no financial backing from a corporation and could stop existing at any time.\r\n• Relatively new distribution, so hard to judge long term stability.\r\n•Release support cycle is even shorter than Fedora\r\n•Documentation is poor and the community is rather small.\r\n• Some strange defaults such as having a separate home partition.\r\n• Uses non LTS kernel and has unknown update schedule for kernel."

Is Mageia beginner friendly? No, and you may find yourself building software packages or being extremely reliant on Flatpaks, Snaps, and AppImages to get by. While it does give you a solid operating system experience, external software is a pain to deal with. Mageia does aim to be beginner friendly, and it shows in quite a few places.\r\n**[Download Mageia](https://www.mageia.org/en/downloads/)**\r\n\r\nIf you are looking for a more vetted beginner friendly distribution, see `sudo info recommended`."
